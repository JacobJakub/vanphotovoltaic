proof of concept not intended to be ever done
For people wanting to calculate their minimum grid size

# Super Simple Vanlife photovoltaic grind calculator

The whole idea is to provide easy and understandable way for a consumer to order the right photovoltanic setup for his Van.
This would include a simple calculator to help calculate the required grid voltage/wattage supply for his day to day needs.

The basic kit would consist of `photovoltanic panels`, `battery charger / computer / monitor`, `batteries` (most likelly *FeLiO4P*)

## To note

  * It doesn NOT take into account grid location. There are numerous websites including NASA's solar radiation map that should be taken into account when calculating your setup
  * This calculator is slightly pessimistic. For example the actual wattage is about 80% of the one provided by manufacturer (who are always very optimistic)
